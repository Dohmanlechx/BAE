    <string name="text_walloftext">"Oh, fancying an egg? That's great. Before even using this awesome app, make sure to read these instructions. You can, of course, boil more than one egg at a time.\n
1. Put the egg in a pot, and fill up the water until the whole egg is wet. Good explanation, eh?
\n2. Bring the water to a boil. Without lid.
\n3. When the water is boiling, lower the heat to medium and start the clock in this app.
\n4. When the time is up, pour off the hot water and refill with cold, covering the egg.
\n5. Eat your egg. But peel it first."</string>
